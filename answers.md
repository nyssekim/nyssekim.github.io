 "_Of course_," she whispered. Then, she shouted: "All I need is **a little moxie**!"
 If you're thinking to yourself, **_This is unbelievable_**, you'd probably be right.

 I read this interesting quote the other day:

>"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"

>He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: _VIVE L'IRLANDE_!

 1. Cut the cheese

 Make sure that the cheese is cut into little triangles.

2. Slice the tomatoes

 Be careful when holding the knife.For more help on tomato slicing, see Thomas Jefferson's seminal essay _Tom Ate Those_.
 We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.
1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.  
 Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.  
If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.  
 Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

 ## Exercise 2
 **HTML**, in full **hypertext markup language**, a formatting system for displaying material  
 retrieved over the [Internet](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Internet). Each retrieval  
 unit is known as a Web page (from World Wide Web), and such pages frequently contain  
 [hypertext](https://www.britannica.com/technology/hypertext) links that allow related pages to  
 be retrieved. **HTML** is the markup language for _encoding_ Web pages.

 **SGML**, in full **standard generalized markup language**, an international computer standard  
 for the definition of [markup languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language); that is,  
 it is a metalanguage. Markup consists of notations called “tags,” which specify the function of  
 a piece of text or how it is to be displayed. SGML emphasizes descriptive markup, in which a tag  
 might be <emphasis>. Such a markup denotes the document function, and it could be interpreted as  
 reverse video on a computer screen, underlining by a typewriter, or _italics_ in typeset text.  
 SGML is used to specify **DTD**s (document type definitions).

  private int age;

  public Person(string initialName)
